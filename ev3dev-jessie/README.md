ev3dev-jessie
=============

This directory contains everything for building ev3dev variants based on Debian
Jessie.

There are 4 hardware platforms:
* `bone`: BeagleBone White/Black/Green
* `ev3`: LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3
* `ev3_ros`: LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 with ROS (roscpp)
* `rpi`: Raspberry Pi 0/1
* `rpi2`: Rapsberry Pi 2/3

There are 2 package variants:
* `base`: minimal install
* `generic`: contains many scripting languages (used for official image release)

Each variant is composes of "layers" defined in the `layers` directory. Each
"layer" there generally produces two docker "layers".

Each layer conforms to the following rules:

* The directory is copied to the docker file using the dockerfile `COPY` command.
* The layer should contain a `brickstrap/<layer>` subdirectory where `<layer`>
    is the name of the layer (same name as the parent directory).

    The `brickstrap` directory can contain the following components.

    * `<layer>/run`: An executable file that performs the task of setting up the layer.
        This usually contains an `apt-get install` command and any other tweaks
        needed. This script should be kept to a minimum. It is preferred that
        as much configuration as possible is done by the packages themselves
        rather than manually here.
    * `_tar-exclude`: A text file containing a list of files that should be
        excluded from a SD card image file created from this docker image.
        This file is usually appended from the `run` script, otherwise it would
        be overwritten by new layers.
    * `_tar-only`: A directory containing a file structure that will be overlaid
        on the docker image root file system when creating an SD card image from
        the docker image.

* The `brickstrap/<layer>/run` script is run using the dockerfile `RUN` command.

The dockerfile that will be used to actually create an image that will be released
should contain the following:

    ARG BRICKSTRAP_IMAGE_NAME=unknown-ev3dev-jessie-image
    ENV BRICKSTRAP_IMAGE_NAME ${BRICKSTRAP_IMAGE_NAME}
    RUN echo "$BRICKSTRAP_IMAGE_NAME" > /etc/ev3dev-release

This allows a unique image name to be passed each time the image is built.
